# Age_Detection
This project predicts a person’s age from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Facial features are extracted through image preprocessing and analyzed to estimate age accurately. The system can be extended for real-time webcam prediction or web-based deployment.

#Overview
The Age Detection Project uses deep learning to estimate a person’s age from facial images. The CNN model is trained on preprocessed facial images and can be extended for real-time webcam predictions or web deployment. This system provides a hands-on example of machine learning applied to computer vision.

# Features
- Predicts age from input facial images
- Uses CNN for accurate age estimation
- Preprocessing of images for better model performance
- Can be extended to real-time or web-based applications
