# Age_Detection
This project predicts a person’s age from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Facial features are extracted through image preprocessing and analyzed to estimate age accurately. The system can be extended for real-time webcam prediction or web-based deployment.

#Overview :

This project uses deep learning to estimate a person’s age from facial images. A CNN model is trained on preprocessed images, and an interactive script or app allows for predictions. It demonstrates practical use of machine learning in computer vision.

#Features :

-Predicts age from input facial images
-Uses CNN for accurate age estimation
-Preprocessing of images for better performance
-Can be extended to real-time or web-based applications

#How to Use :

Requirements: numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras, opencv-python, matplotlib, seaborn
Run the prediction script or app: streamlit run app.py

#Tools & Libraries:

-Python
-TensorFlow / Keras
-OpenCV
-NumPy, Pandas
-Matplotlib, Seaborn

#Future Improvements :

-Add more facial images to improve accuracy
-Implement real-time webcam prediction
-Deploy as a web application
-Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning
